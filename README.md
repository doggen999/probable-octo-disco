# Probable octo disco

Responsive, paginated and sortable product listing made with React.

## tl;dr

`npm i && npm start` and open `./dist/index.html` (**N.B.** you have to open .dist/index.html explicitly, e.g. with Live Server).

### Development and bundling

`npm start` creates a development bundle with HMR to `./dist/index.html` (open in a web browser or with e.g. Live Server).

`npm run build` and `npm run build:dev` bundles to `./dist`, with development and production settings respectively.
